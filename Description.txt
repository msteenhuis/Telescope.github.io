The main issue I had to overcome with this project was creating a satisfactory header and photo gallery. I wanted the header to contain the title on the left-hand side and the links to the rest of the webpage on the right-hand side. I used a flexbox in order to modify space in the header, and used the (justify-content: space-between;) command which distributed the title and list of webpages to the ends of the website. I then indented the list and title using padding. When chaing to a mobile screen, I changed the height of the footer in order to contain the links, and then centered the text so both the text and links would be in the center of the page.

For each of the photo galleries, I used a grid layout. It would change from a 3 x 2 while the page is smaller then 775 pixels, 2 x 3 when smaller then 1200 pixels, and 1 x 6 for larger sizes. I used the media query command to make the photo gallery change.
