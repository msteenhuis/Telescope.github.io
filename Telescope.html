  <h1>Telescopes allow humans to admire the alluring land of the stars. However, finding and choosing a good telescope relies on several factors. These are: 
  </h1>
  <h2>Aperture</h2>
    <p>The aperture measures the diameter of a telescope's lens or mirror. A larger aperture will collect more light and give the viewer a sharper and brighter view. This helps you see fainter objects in the sky, like distant galaxies and nebulae. Unlike other factors, you cannot change the aperture of your telescope, so consider investing in a telescope with an aperture of at least 6 inches.
    </p>
  <h2>Magnification</h2>
    <p> Magnification allows the user to enlarge the view of the image. However, more than magnification is needed to enhance your view. To best utilize a telescope with large magnification, you need a large aperture to enlarge the image without losing the quality of your image. Typically, astronomers recommend a magnification of 20 to 50 times your aperture, with better views usually coming from lower powers. For instance, if your telescope has an aperture of 8 inches, you should have a magnification of 160x to 400x. Eyepieces are commonly used to change magnification.
    </p>
  <h2>Focal Length</h2>
    <p>While magnification allows the user to enlarge a view, focal length determines how much space can be captured by your telescope. However, the focal length also interacts with your telescope's magnification and aperture. As stated earlier, by adding an eyepiece, which has a focal length, you can change your telescope's magnification - with eyepieces with a shorter focal length increasing the magnification. 
    </p>
    <p>By dividing the focal length by the aperture, we get the focal ratio, a value with many applications. While larger focal ratios of 7 and more typically have a higher magnification and low field of view, great for viewing objects in our solar system, smaller focal ratios have a greater field of view with a lower magnification, ideal for viewing galaxies and nebulae. A lower focal ratio is typically brighter than higher focal ratios, which is suitable for viewing celestial objects further away from Earth. Thus, the focal length of your telescope is a significant factor to consider when determining what you want and how you want to view the galaxy.

  <h1>Lastly, lets talk about what to view with a telescope. There are 2 main categories of celestial objects that people view with a telescope:</h1>
  <h2>Deep-Sky Objects</h2>
  <p>Deep-Sky Objects consist of star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies. Because these objects are many light years away from Earth, they are fainter then other celestial objects, necessitating an aperture of at least 6 inches, but preferably 8 inches or greater. So, a Newtonion/Dobsonian telescope is best suited for this role, as they have large apertures for a relatively low price. As stated earlier, a low focal ratio and long focal length is preferred because it both brightens deep-space objects and increases the telescope field of view. </p>
  <h2>Solar System Objects and Stars</h2>
  <p>Planets, Moons, Satellites, and Comets, and nearby Stars are all bright objects that occupy our night sky. For this reason, I would choose a Refractor telescope to view these objects. The telescope makes up for their relatively small aperture with great sharpness and contrast, and the objects themselves supply the telescope with plenty of light. I would recommend having a high focal ratio and long focal length in order to focus and capture the detail of these objects.</p>
