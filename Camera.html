    <h1>Before You Buy an Astrophotography Camera...</h1>
      <p>There are plenty of adaptors to mount your phone and/or camera onto a telescope. Astrophotography is very difficult to perfect, so taking pictures with a camera you already own is a perfectly valid way to photograph the galaxy. If you are undeterred by this message and want to capture the land of the stars using a dedicated astrophotography camera, you may continue...</p>
    <h1>Monochrome v Color Cameras</h1>
      <p>While most would choose to buy a color camera at first glance, most astrophotographers use monochrome cameras. Monochrome cameras present several advantages, most notably:
      </p>
  <ul class="tableList">
    <li>Performing better in nighttime conditions</li>
    <li>Better bandwidth and frame rates</li>
    <li>More efficient algorithms for processing and rendering photos</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The main advantage of a color camera is that it does not require the user to manually change color filters. Monochrome cameras will give the user brilliant photos of space, but in order to capture a colorful image, a monochrome camera requires the user to use multiple color filters in order to capture color. While color cameras are certainly easier to use, I would recommend using a monochrome camera to capture some stellar images.

  <h1>Pixel Sizes</h1>
    <p>Once you have decided which type of camera to use, it is important to consider the ideal pizels sizes for your telescope. A pixel size too high could result in undersampling, a size too low could result in oversampling. A great resource to find the best pixel size is this chart below:</p>
